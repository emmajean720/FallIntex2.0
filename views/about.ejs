    <!-- Our Tech Tab -->
    <div id="tech" class="tab-content">
      <p>Foam clothing technology was invented by outdoor survival expert Jim Phillips. He has done extensive testing using open-cell polyurethane foam as the insulation layer in jackets, hoods, pants, boots, gloves, and sleeping bags.</p>
      <p>Jim Phillips' foam clothing is brilliant technology because of what it can do to help save a person's life in freezing temperatures. The insulation layer foam clothing provides is so effective that even if a person gets wet it will keep them warm — but wearing synthetic fabrics is an important layer to include with the foam clothing. Foam clothing can be effective while wearing cotton if the wearer stays dry, but if the wearer gets wet, the cotton will absorb and hold water, keeping the wearer cold. If a person is not wearing any cotton with the foam clothing, and they happen to get wet, they will still be able to maintain their core body temperature. This works because the shell and lining fabrics and the foam are all synthetic and breathable, providing moisture-wicking properties and allowing perspiration and other moisture to evaporate.</p>
      <p>Foam clothing dramatically reduces moisture as a threat to a person's life in the cold!</p>
      <p>Foam clothing is marketed to emergency preparedness and extreme sports audiences due to its ability to keep people warm in winter conditions. Being cold is one thing, but being cold and wet is miserable. Being cold, wet, and without shelter can be life-threatening.</p>
      <p>This technology is usually sold in emergency preparedness venues and is quite expensive. While it makes sense due to the high value of the technology, we believe that no one should have to endure freezing temperatures. That's why we created the Turtle Shelter, a foam vest that covers the core and harnesses the wearer's body heat even while wet and in freezing temperatures.</p>
      <p><strong>Jen's perspective:</strong> Every life has value!</p>
      <blockquote>
        "Hearing about this technology in an emergency preparedness venue provoked a lot of thought about how many homeless people's lives could not only be saved but also improved by this technology. Emergency preparedness is all about people getting prepared for when disaster strikes...and it seems like getting prepared can be pretty pricey...but isn't a person who is homeless living in their emergency right this very moment? They are not waiting for disaster to strike because, for them, it already has, and I know from experience that once the disaster of homelessness strikes, it can be extremely hard to recover from it. For many, it is far more than simply losing a home or a place to stay...for me and many others, it was also about losing my confidence, my energy, my drive, and even my hope...I felt completely broken and defeated!
        I remember how every simple task felt like an overwhelming obstacle, especially when it was so cold I couldn't even think. Everything just felt harder when it was cold, wet, and miserable... I believe that this foam clothing can help relieve some of the suffering for anyone who is homeless and living in the cold... I believe it doesn't have to cost a lot to make these. Not for the homeless and not for our families... lives can be saved from this technology."

    <!-- Homelessness/Hypothermia Tab -->
    <div id="homelessness" class="tab-content">
      <p>Each year, as winter approaches and the temperature begins to drop, many homeless people move from the streets to their city's shelter system to escape the cold. However, few communities have city-wide cold-weather response plans, and many of the plans currently in place leave gaping holes in accessibility.</p>
      <p>In rural areas, shelters often have no outside resources to help them cope with the increased demand caused by cold weather conditions. Many shelters or cities offer expanded winter services only during certain months or when the temperature falls below a pre-determined and arbitrary cut-off temperature. Above those cut-offs (hypothermia can occur in weather as warm as 50 degrees Fahrenheit), many cities do not offer resources to help the homeless people escape from the cold.</p>
      <p>Without a carefully constructed winter plan, homeless service facilities may find themselves unable to accommodate the influx of residents, and some of those people who seek shelter are turned out into the cold. With nowhere to stay except the streets, people experiencing homelessness have a much higher risk than the general population of developing exposure-related conditions such as hypothermia and frostbite. These conditions can be immediately life-threatening and may also increase the risk of dying from unrelated conditions in the future. Increased homeless services, especially additional shelter availability, are necessary to accommodate the amplified need in the winter.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long have you been doing this?</h3>
        <p>Jen got the idea for the Turtle Shelter Project in 2015 to help keep people experiencing homelessness from freezing to death. We officially incorporated on April 3, 2017, on Jen's sobriety anniversary. Our 501(c)(3) status was granted in 2018.</p>
        <p>Between September 2017 and January 2018, with a combined 450 volunteer hours, we completed 50 prototype vests for testing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>If you want to help homeless people be warm, why not just do a coat drive?</h3>
        <p>The foam insulation layer combined with moisture-wicking fabrics creates a more effective insulation layer than other winter clothing. Clothing made from foam will provide warmth even if it is wet – it allows the wearer to maintain their core body temperature. You can read more about it in "OUR TECH."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What does the turtle in your logo have to do with your project?</h3>
        <p>A turtle carries its shelter wherever it goes. Our insulated vests are intended to be a portable "shelter." Instead of having to find shelter, a person can carry their shelter on their back, like a turtle.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How/where are the vests distributed?</h3>
        <p>During the winter of 2017-18, the distribution and testing were done mainly in the Ogden area with the help and support of The Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd and the staff at Youth Futures.</p>
        <p>In winter 2018-19, we distributed vests to shelters and individuals in the Ogden and Salt Lake City communities.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why don't you give out the vests for free?</h3>
        <p>The cost of production is about $300 per vest. For a complete shelter, we aim for low-cost production that maintains dignity for those who receive the vests and also provides income to those who help us make them.</p>
